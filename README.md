Prerequisites

Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
A PostgreSQL database server running.
Clone the Repository

Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bloodLink.git
Use code with caution.
Install Dependencies

Bash
cd bloodLink
npm install
Use code with caution.
Database Configuration

Create a .env file in the project root directory.
Add the following environment variable to the .env file, replacing the placeholder with your actual database password:

Additional Notes

This README provides a foundational overview of bloodLink. You can extend its functionality by:
Implementing search functionalities for blood donors based on blood group, location, etc.
Integrating with external APIs for real-time blood availability updates.
Adding a user interface (UI) framework like Bootstrap or React for a more visually appealing and interactive experience.
Remember to replace placeholder email addresses and database credentials with your own information for secure operation.
